### Feedback

As my two friends first saw the graph, they all thought the graph is simple enough, so the principle â€œ less is more" is meeted. But one of them did not understand what is the bottom blue line is about. After read carefully she realized that it is the precip. Both of them feel that the graph is for tourism or student who want to know the weather information. And she suggested me that giving the precip seperate unit scale for the precip. And they both suggest me the line out the max and min for each line so that the audience can understand the 

### The process for my final version                  

I want to retain the original format of the graph basically, a linear graph is effective enough to illustrate the information of the weather data. But it needs some changes for the detail of the graph. First I want to change the color of the min temperature of the graph from green to light red (pink) so that the audience can know the upper three lines are in a group ( temperature data) and the bottom blue line is another category (precip). Besides, the original x-aixs and y-axis did not say something about what are they about. I will label the x-axis and y-axis more clearly, and also labeling the four line as well so that the audience can know what are the four line about. 

After asking my audience advice, I want to change the scale unit for precip  so that the audience can see there are two different unit for y-axis more intuitively. Moreover, the advice labeling the max and min for each line is good. Thus, I will add them.
